[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

**Example:**

**Input:** [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
**Output:** 49

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int max = 0;
        while(left < right) {
            max = Math.max(max,(right-left)*Math.min(height[left],height[right]));
            if(height[left] < height[right]) left++;
            else right--;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
