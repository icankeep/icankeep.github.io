[278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**

Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false

call isBadVersion(5) -> true

call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version.

## 时间复杂度O(lgn)，空间复杂度O(1)

```java
int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
这种写法可能会发生整型溢出
应改为
int mid = (hi - lo) / 2 + lo;
或者
int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
```

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int lo = 1;
        int hi = n;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
            boolean bad = isBadVersion(mid);
            if (bad)
                hi = mid;
            else
                lo = mid + 1;
        }
        return lo;
    }
}
```
