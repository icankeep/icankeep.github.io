[154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)


Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5]  Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,0,1]  Output: 0

Note:
- This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
- Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## 最坏时间复杂度Ｏ(n)，平均Ｏ(lgn)，空间复杂度Ｏ(1)

`while(lo < hi && nums[lo] == nums[hi]) lo++;`

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int lo = 0;
        int hi = nums.length - 1;
        while(lo < hi) {
            while(lo < hi && nums[lo] == nums[hi]) lo++;
            int mid = (lo + hi)/2;
            if(nums[mid] > nums[hi]) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[lo];
    }
}
```
